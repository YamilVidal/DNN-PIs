# DNN-PIs
This aims to be a list of **PIs** that use **Deep Neural Networks** to model cognitive processes. It is imperfect (e.g. some PostDocs might have managed to sneak in) and incomplete. It's first version was the result of gathering names mentioned by the community in response of a [tweet](https://twitter.com/YamilVidal_arg/status/1501881398403252229). If you notice any error or would like to add a name, please send a pull request or contact me.

Thanks!
